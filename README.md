Most Nigerian Universities were forced to adopt Virtual Learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When it was adopted, it was strange and new to most students and caused a lot of differences among the students because the effect on students' academic performance and pocket were different, as it favored some and affect others. In this paper, the regular (Physical Classroom) and the newly adopted method (Virtual) were compared and contrasted based on their effect on student's academic performance, cost, and preference of the students in the College of Physical Sciences, Funaab. The cost of running the two methods and the GPA (Grade Point Average) obtained from the students using an online questionnaire were considered. 300-level and 400-level students were sampled being the only level that has partaken in the two methods. 50 students each from five departments in the college given a total sample of 250 respondents. Paired difference test, two-sample z-test, and Analysis of Variance were used for the analysis of the data. The analysis reveals that there is a significant difference in the cost of running the methods and also shows a significant difference in the GPA of the students. The results obtained also reveals that no department performed better than the other during the two methods of teaching. Also, many students preferred Physical Classrooms to Virtual.
